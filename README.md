For earlier introduction, please refer to The analysis of [WMC 2017](https://github.com/axarekma/WMC_2017_CUP)


- I parsed the standings 23/08.
- Cup is now played on all lanes
- Starting lanes are from the old bracket


Shown here are MC siumulations of the brackets and the probability of the winner.
